## My process
  Adding the core HTML elements were super easy, I just dont have a lot opf practice with CSS and most if it is old and rusty, so I was banging my head against the wall on a couple things.

  ### Built with

    - Semantic HTML5 markup
    - CSS custom properties


  ### What I learned

    Setting the .attributions class to 100% width allowed me to center the text in the middle of the screen

  ### Continued development

    I need more work in CSS and the up to date way of the way things work
